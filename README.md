## La Capitaine Theme
La Capitaine Look and Feel/Theme for KDE Plasma 5
# How to install
Run this on any Linux distribution with KDE:

`wget http://bit.ly/la-capitaine && sh la-capitaine`

That will install everything you need and clean itself up. Ignore any errors it may produce unless the permissions for a folder are denied.

If you're not on an ubuntu-based distribution, however, it will NOT install the [SierraBreeze window decoration] (https://github.com/ishovkun/SierraBreeze).

Applying the La Capitaine or La Capitaine Dark look and feel will not activate the SierraBreeze window decoration. To do that, just go into Application Style > Window Decorations and apply it. It also will not apply the Lato fonts which need to be manually applied. The recommended font settings are:

> General: Lato 10
>
> Fixed width: <unchanged>
>
> Small: Lato 8
>
> Toolbar: Lato 10
>
> Menu: Lato 10
>
> Window title: Lato 10 semibold
